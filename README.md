# Mastodon embed tester

Trying out various means to embed Mastodon Toots and Timelines (and combinations of other things)

Toots are straightforward to embed (Mastodon supports oEmbed, and has an embed code option on the web UI), timelines [need a bit more work](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/6094).
